0.4.1

- improved detection of invalid frames and, therefore, of non-MPEG Audio files

- worked through HIP code:
	- removed printfs and exits
	- activated layer 1 and 2 support
	- changed some interface things to work better with DecMPA

0.4.0

- reorganized API in a way that should allow it to remain downward
  compatible in future releases

- the decoder parameters are no longer passed directly to DecMPA_Create
  but are now set using a new function, DecMPA_SetParam.

- added API version checking to ensure that the DLL is compatible

- added a new function DecMPA_DecodeNoData to the API. It can be used
  to perform a quick scan through a file without actually decoding
  any audio data

- added an ease-of-use function (DecMPA_CreateForFile) for creating a
  decoder object that reads its input data from a file

- ID3v2 data can now be returned

- more code clean-up

- revamped seek code - seeks are now performed instantly when the
  Seek function is called, instead of at the next decode

- more accurate calculation of seek position for VBR streams

- better calculation of decode-time

- improved duration estimation

- corrected some issues on big endian systems

- fixed a few other bugs


0.3.0

- integrated new decoding routines (from Lame/HIP) in addition to the "old"
  SPlay decoding

- added a mechanism to choose between HIP and SPlay decoding routines at
  compile time

- wrote a new frame finder that adds quite a bit of robustness and also
  allows DecMPA to detect if the data is not mpeg audio. The new finder
  also greatly reduces the risk to detect frames wrong after seeking.

- threw out more old unnecessary Mpeglib stuff and rewrote/simplified some
  other parts.


0.2.2

- disabled "downsampling" again - it only reduced the frequency by half instead
  of synthesizing with twice the frequency and THEN reducing it by half.
  Thus the quality was definitely NOT improved.

0.2.1

- added workaround for Visual C++ compiler bug that caused occasional
  artifacts when decoding some MP3s


0.2

- MP3 synthesis is now performed with downsampling, resulting in improved
  quality

- leading ID3v2 tags are now automatically skipped over, fixing some
  problems with corrupted tags that contain unescaped "sync" values.
  This also improves length detection for files with big ID3 tags.

- removed some more old MPEGLib code that is unnecessary for pure audio
  decoding



0.1.8

- added an example application "decodefile"

- added makefile and project file for new example to the "build" directory

- cleaned the code up a bit, removed some unnecessary includes

- the source files in the tar.gz archive now have UNIX-style linebreaks.
  this fixes some issues with compilers that weren't able to cope with the
  Windows-style linebreaks

- changed some code in the build-tools for potability.

- added makefiles for Digital Unix and Cygwin GCC


0.1.5

- added ability to create documentation with makefiles

- added readme files about makefile usage

- changed the interface of DecMPA_Create - it now accepts a POINTER to
  DecMPA_Callbacks rather than an object.

- fixed some portability issues

- fixed a nasty bug in decmpa.h: DecMPA_Create did not have the DECMPA_CC
  calling convention (resulting in possible loss of binary interoperability
  with dlls created by different compilers)

- fixed gcc commandline when creating a DLL - the DLL is now relocatable
  and binary compatible with the VC6 generated DLL


0.1

- initial release
