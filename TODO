Bug fixes:
  Broken MP3: http://sbooth.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1103
  Windows M3U paths: http://sbooth.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1209
?  Playlist display: http://sbooth.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1050
  Fix playlist logic. http://sbooth.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=762&highlight=document+based+playlist
    Note: Never load duplicates in a group of files. Ex: If you load an m3u containing a bunch of files AND the files themselves, only load them once! However, if you load the m3u, THEN load the group of files, they should appear twice!
  Hook up various menu items. Add missing functions and generally fix the menu.
