Bug fixes:
  Broken MP3: http://sbooth.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1103
?  Playlist display: http://sbooth.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1050
  Fix playlist/file loading so it never loads duplicates in a single action. Ex: If you load (an m3u containing a bunch of files) AND (the files themselves), only load them once! However, if you load the m3u, THEN load the group of files, they should appear twice!
