10.3 USERS!!!

If you are using 10.3.8 or below, I'd like to hear from you. I'm trying to
support all 10.3 systems, as I heard some people have had troubles with
10.3.9, and won't upgrade to it.
I can only fix this if people who actually run those systems wish to help
me debug Cog. Thanks!

    Cog is released under the GPL. See COPYING for details.

    The libraries folder contains various decoding and tagging
libraries, which i have created Xcode projects for, and possibly modified
to make compile on OS X. The various libraries are under each of their own
licenses.

    Please note that vulgar language may be contained in the source code.
It is rated M for mature by the ESRB, the MPAA, and whatever else deems it
unsuitable for virgin ears.

    All Cog code is copywrited by me, and is licensed under the GPL.
    
	If you would like the photoshop sources for the various icons and
graphics, please send me an email, and I will be happy to get them to you.

  Share and enjoy.
