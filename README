	NOTE ABOUT BUTTONS:
	If you are under impression that the buttons are acting strange,
they actually may be acting as intended. The back button goes through
the history of the songs played, that is,it goes to the "previously played"
song, not just the one before it in the playlist. So, for example, if you
had shuffle mode on, and then turned it off, you could go back through the
songs played during shuffle mode. The forward button acts as expected, where
if shuffle is on, it will pick a random song, and if not it goes to the next
song in the playlist.
	Please comment on, whether you like this behaviour or not!
