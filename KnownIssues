Font resize of playlist does not change file tree, and 
does not resize columns (needs a lower bound)

Code for seeking should be moved into the AudioPlayer,
so we can escape ugly event* functions (the problem is
that the AppController needs access to seeker functions
because of apple remote seeking incrementally)

Repeat state Repeat Album is missing. Repeat All is 
naively implemented in the playbackController, and
does not heed Shuffle.

Shuffle parts of the playlistController need rewrite,
they still go by the old repeat code.

mp3 bitrate is a tad off.
