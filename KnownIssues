Font resize of playlist does not change file tree, and 
does not resize columns (needs a lower bound)

Code for seeking should be moved into the AudioPlayer,
so we can escape ugly event* functions (the problem is
that the AppController needs access to seeker functions
because of apple remote seeking incrementally)

Shuffle list is not reshuffled when shuffling reaches
start or end of it (in Repeat All mode)

Repeat Album isn't implemented.

mp3 bitrate is a tad off.
